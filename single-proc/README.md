## Single Proc

This dockerfile create new image from scratch.
Just trying on docker challenge to create smallest image.
We can't run bash script on scratch, so i create binary from asm code.
But there are smaller images than this one.

**How to run this code?**
```
~ docker build -t yourname/single-proc .
```
